Hi, My name is Aditya and I'm currently a summer intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico in the Data Science at Scale summer school. 
I'll be starting my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities from Fall 2017.

<p>
I've a Masters degree in Computer Science from University of Utah, <a href ="www.cs.utah.edu">[School of Computing]</a> in the summer 
of 2016. I was advised by <a href = "http://sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html">Prof. Martin Berzins</a> , during my time at the 
<a href = "sci.utah.edu">Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute </a> in the <a href="utah.edu">University of Utah]</a>. 
Earlier, I got my Bachelors degree in Information Technology at <a href = "http://jntuh.ac.in/">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University]</a>, Hyderabad, India where I was mentored by Prof. P Gopalakrishna.
</p>

<p>
My research interests broadly lie in the area of High Performance Computing(HPC) and Computer Systems. I'm fascinated by the efforts in the field of HPC to build an Exascale machine by 2022, within the power and energy constraints. I also have a keen research interest in the area of Numerical Analysis and computer systems.
