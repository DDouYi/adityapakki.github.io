Hi there! My name is Aditya and I'm a second year Ph.D student in 
[Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.umn.edu)
at the University of Minnesota. My research interests are in the areas of
computer security, operating systems, and Machine Learning. I'm fortunate to be
advised by [Prof. Kangjie Lu](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/).

<p>
I've earned a Masters degree in Computer Science from University of Utah,
[School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu) in the summer of 2016. I was
advised by <a href = "http://sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Berzins</a>,
during my time at the 
<a href = "https://sci.utah.edu" target="_blank">Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute </a>
in the <a href="utah.edu" target="_blank">University of Utah </a>. 
Earlier, I got my Bachelors degree in Information Technology at 
<a href = "http://jntuh.ac.in/" target="_blank">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University</a>,
Hyderabad, India where I was mentored by P Gopalakrishna.

I've spent the entirety of my childhood in [Hyderabad, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad), mostly playing football and biking around.
