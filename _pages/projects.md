My research interests broadly lie in the area of High Performance Computing(HPC) and Computer Systems. I'm fascinated by the efforts in the field of HPC to build an Exascale machine by 2022, within the power and energy constraints. I also have a keen research interest in the area of Numerical Analysis and computer systems.
