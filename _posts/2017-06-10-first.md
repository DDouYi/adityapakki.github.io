desc: Why be a minimalist ?
---
There certainly are going to be days when you feel claustrophobic about the 
space you live in or when you find that your keys have again gone on a trip
without you? Another scenario would be pondering on what to wear post that
morning shower ? These are some mundanely common occureneces that drive people
crazy. What can I do to make my life easier in these circumstances ? The answer
to all of them is to choose a minimalist life.

What does minimalism entail ? Minimalism is the way of life where you pare down
your possessions to the minimum that would help you enjoy life as well as live
in a clutter free state of mind. To reiterate, you don't have to donate all the
clothes in your closet right away or give away your furniture in your house or
move into a 220 sft. trailer house to practise minimalism. You can start your
journey by just dumping the old newspapers from your house.

There are some amazing benefits to pracitising a life as a minimalist. Let us
just stop and rethink once before you order a14 inch pizza instead of 12 inch
all for yourself ! Be conservative, be a minimalist.
